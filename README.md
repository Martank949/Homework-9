## Description of my Project:
Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - 
what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, 
and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely 
to use and contribute to the success of the project.

## Installation Instructions:
To generate your own README, first run npm install in order to install the following npm package 
dependencies as specified in the package.json. The application itself can be invoked with node index.js.

## Usage Information:
When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you 
in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.
fs.writeFile is used to generate your project's README.md file. 

## Contribution Guidelines:
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature.
3. Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some features'.
4. Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature.
5. Submit a pull request.
## Test Instructions:
Check out the ExampleREADME.md in this repo as an example.
